Developed customer segmentation models using K-Means, DBSCAN, and Hierarchical Clustering to analyze customer
demographics and behavior.
• Optimized cluster performance by evaluating models with metrics such as Silhouette Score (improved from 0.1854 to 0.3827
using DBSCAN) and Davies-Bouldin Index.
• Enhanced clustering performance by applying advanced data preprocessing and scaling techniques, enabling meaningful
segmentation of customer demographics and behaviors
